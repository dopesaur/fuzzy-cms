# Fuzzy CMS

One file CMS written in PHP (not really, see the disclaimer).

## "So wut the point?"

The point is... wait for it... play well with FTP and git, and be efficient, pretty much that.

I know there's deployment systems (based on git), and other cool stuff for cool guys, and bla bla bla, **but** 
one tiny CMS in a file (in few files, actually, see the disclaimer) with ability to version **everything** is quite cool.

What do you think of that?

## Features

Fuzzy has following features:

* Very simple (procedural/functional) code
* Can be compressed to one file with extensions and themes (core size is 10-20kb)
* Has a Phar builder
* CMS can be converted to static website
* Support of different text processors and API for adding processors (Markdown, etc.)
* Extension API

## Benefits of using this CMS

There are some benefits of using this CMS:

1. ~~No one will try to modify or steal CMS from you~~
2. ~~Sometimes it's tiny, simple, and fast~~

Not really :smile:

There are some **real** benefits of using this CMS: 

1. It's fast, 'cuz there's no real database
2. It's simple, no complicated settings or so, just grab copy and set `777` permission to content folder, and that's it!
3. It's tiny, few files and that's it!
4. Less chances of somebody being dig into your code (haha compressed file, phhh)

That's everything I can think of.

## "I wanna build it myself!"

Go into console to the repository directory and run: 

```
# Make it
chmod a+x bin/build.sh 

# Build it
./bin/build.sh
```

To build everything (core and two themes).

## "No, thanks, I'll take two compressed ones."

There are also already built files which are located in `build` directory.

* `index.php` is core file
* `themes/default.php` is default template
* `themes/admin.php` is admin template

To install this CMS, you need to copy those files (`index.php` and folder `themes`) to your website folder. 

Then you need to copy `content` and `assets` directories to your new website.

# Disclaimer 

This CMS is not actually one file. Its core and themes can be compressed down to one file, but it never would be one file because of `assets` and `content` (How would you put SQLite database in *one file with CMS*?! I'm crazy, but not that way crazy).
