## Planned features

There are some features that I would like to implement in Fuzzy:

- [x] Extension API (extending and stuff)
- [x] API for integrating different text/config formatters (markdown, textile, etc.)
- [x] Data files (custom data you can use anywhere)
- [x] Flexible content management
- [x] Custom layouts
- [x] Build static website out of `content` and of all the extensions
- [x] PHAR utility for building the CMS
- [ ] Ability to cache content into `db.sqlite`
- [x] Browse content API

You can suggest your own features in the issues, read the next section.

## Features request?

You can request features (if you would like, of course). It would be also helpful if you would document them [requested features] and post them in GitHub issues. 

If I will consider your feature useful or interesting, I might add it to the list, or, less possible, implement it as separate extension (see 'Extension API' feature).
