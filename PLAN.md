# Plan for next streams

_We_ need to finish this CMS at some point, so there's a list of features that I would like to see in Fuzzy. 

## Planned features

There are some features that I would like to implement in Fuzzy (funny name, huh?):

- [x] Extension API (extending and stuff)
- [x] API for integrating different text/config formatters (markdown, textile, etc.)
- [x] Data files (custom data you can use anywhere)
- [x] Flexible content management
- [x] Custom layouts
- [ ] Browse content API
- [ ] Build static website out of `content` and of all the extensions (next stream)
- [ ] Ability to cache content into `db.sqlite` (next stream, probably)
- [ ] phar utility for building the CMS

More to come...

## Feature request?

During streams you can request features (if you would like, of course). It would be also helpful if you would document them [requested features] and post them in GitHub issues (with flag "feature request" in square brackets). 

If I will consider your feature useful or interesting, I might add it to the list, or, less possible, implement it as separate extension (see 'Extension API' feature).
